## üåü Features

### Core Functionality
- **Graph-based City Modeling**: Nodes as intersections, edges as roads with customizable weights
- **Optimal Path Finding**: Dijkstra's algorithm implementation with multiple weight considerations
- **Multiple Route Options**: Yen's algorithm for k-shortest paths (top 3 alternatives)

### Visualization Features
- **Interactive Traffic Heatmap**: Color-coded edges (green=fast, red=congested)
- **Dynamic Congestion Zones**: Manually adjust congestion levels
- **Time-based Weighting**: Automatic weight adjustments by time of day
- **Path Highlighting**: Clear visualization of recommended routes

### Advanced Features
- **Traffic Alert System**: Automatic congestion detection and alerts
- **User Reporting**: Crowd-sourced traffic updates
- **Export Functionality**: PDF route summaries with detailed information
